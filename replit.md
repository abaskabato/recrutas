## Overview

Built on AI. Backed by transparency. Focused on you.

Recrutas connects job seekers directly with hiring managers. No recruiters, no middlemen - just real conversations with the people who make hiring decisions. Take a company's test, pass it, and unlock direct chat access. We aggregate jobs from 500+ companies so you can find opportunities and talk to real people, not sales reps.

## System Architecture

- **Profile Management**: Comprehensive candidate profiles with skills and experience
- **Resume Parsing**: AI-powered resume analysis and data extraction
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure session management with role-based routing

## Data Flow

### Job Matching Process
1. **Job Ingestion**: External jobs scraped and internal jobs created
2. **Candidate Analysis**: User skills and preferences analyzed
3. **AI Matching**: Semantic matching algorithm generates compatibility scores
4. **Ranking**: Jobs ranked by match percentage and relevance
5. **Delivery**: Real-time job recommendations delivered to candidates

### Application Workflow
1. **Job Discovery**: Candidates browse matched jobs
2. **Exam Taking**: Candidates complete job-specific assessments
3. **Qualification**: Passing candidates unlock direct chat access
4. **Communication**: Direct messaging with hiring managers
5. **Tracking**: Application status updates and notifications

### Data Storage
- **User Data**: Profiles, skills, experience, and preferences
- **Job Data**: Postings, requirements, and matching metadata
- **Application Data**: Exam results, chat logs, and application status
- **Analytics Data**: Match scores, user interactions, and platform metrics

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **OpenAI API**: AI matching and resume analysis (requires API key)
- **Neon/Supabase**: PostgreSQL database hosting
- **SendGrid**: Email service for notifications (optional)
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for subscriptions (optional)

### Job Data Sources
- **Company Career Pages**: Direct scraping from 500+ companies
- **Job Board APIs**: Integration with major job platforms
- **Hiring Platforms**: ATS system integrations (Workday, Greenhouse, etc.)

### Development Tools
- **Replit**: Development environment and deployment
- **Vercel**: Production deployment platform
- **Railway**: Alternative deployment with database
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Replit environment with live reloading
- **Staging**: Vercel preview deployments for testing
- **Production**: Multiple deployment options (Vercel, Railway, Docker)

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite build generates optimized static assets
- **Backend**: TypeScript compilation with esbuild bundling
- **Assets**: Static file serving with CDN integration
- **Database**: Automated migrations on deployment

### Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless backend design for load balancing
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries and connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for session and data caching
- **CDN Integration**: Asset optimization and global distribution

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Changelog

- June 29, 2025. **ðŸŽ¯ COMPREHENSIVE DEPLOYMENT FIXES IMPLEMENTED** - Applied all suggested fixes for esbuild/Vite import conflicts. Created multiple production build solutions: `build-production-fixed.js` using TypeScript compilation, `build-production-simple.js` with targeted tsx compilation, `server/index-production.ts` with production-safe server entry point, `server/vite-production.ts` for Vite-free utilities, and `server/tsconfig.production.json` for production TypeScript config. All builds exclude Vite dependencies, set NODE_ENV=production, and provide fallback strategies. Verification script `verify-deployment-fixes.js` confirms all fixes are properly implemented. Ready for production deployment on any platform.
- June 29, 2025. **ðŸš€ COMPREHENSIVE VITE DEPLOYMENT FIXES COMPLETED** - Fully resolved all esbuild compilation errors with Vite imports through multiple deployment strategies.
