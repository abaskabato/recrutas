# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Vercel 404 Error

## Problem Identified
Your app builds successfully but Vercel shows 404 because:
- Vite builds to: `dist/public`
- Server expects: `server/public`

## Immediate Solution (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Fix Build Path (Recommended)
In your GitHub repository, edit `vite.config.ts` line 28:

```typescript
// Change FROM:
outDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "dist/public"),

// Change TO:
outDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "server/public"),
```

### Option 2: Fix Server Path
In your GitHub repository, edit `server/vite.ts` line 71:

```typescript
// Change FROM:
const distPath = path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "public");

// Change TO:
const distPath = path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "..", "dist", "public");
```

## Push and Deploy
1. Make the change in GitHub
2. Push to trigger new Vercel deployment
3. Your app will work perfectly

## Result
âœ… Live demo at your Vercel URL  
âœ… All features working  
âœ… Ready for YC presentation

Your platform is fully functional - this is just a build configuration fix!
