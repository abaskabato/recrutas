## ❌ Issues Discovered

### Issue #1: Route Protection Missing (Security) 🚨
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Test:** Unauthenticated user access to protected routes

**Problem:**
Unauthenticated users can directly access `/candidate-dashboard` without being redirected to the login page.

**Expected Behavior:**
- User visits `/candidate-dashboard` without auth
- Should redirect to `/auth`
- After login, redirect back to dashboard

**Actual Behavior:**
- User visits `/candidate-dashboard` without auth
- Page loads and displays content
- No redirect occurs

**Impact:**
- Security vulnerability - protected content accessible without authentication
- Could expose sensitive data

**Fix Required:**
Add authentication middleware to protected routes to check JWT token before rendering.

### Issue #2: Test Selector Mismatch (Non-Critical)
**Severity:** LOW
**Test:** Dashboard tab detection

**Problem:**
Test looks for elements with `role="tab"` attribute, but the actual UI uses different HTML structure for navigation tabs.

**Expected:**
```typescript
const tabs = await page.locator('button[role="tab"], [role="tab"]').count();
```

**Actual:**
Tabs are rendered but without role="tab" attribute. The navigation works fine, just the test selector needs updating.

**Fix Required:**
Update test to use correct selectors matching actual UI structure.
