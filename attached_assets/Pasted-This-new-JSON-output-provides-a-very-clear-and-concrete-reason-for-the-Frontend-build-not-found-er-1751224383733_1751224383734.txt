This new JSON output provides a very clear and concrete reason for the "Frontend build not found" error:

```json
{
  "error": "Frontend build not found",
  "buildPath": "/var/task/dist", // Vercel expected your frontend build here
  "files": [".v8-cache", "api", "node_modules", "package.json"] // These are the files it actually found
}
```

**What this tells you definitively:**

1.  **Vercel is looking for your frontend build output in a folder named `dist`** within the root of your deployed project (which corresponds to `/var/task/dist` on the Vercel server).
2.  **The `dist` folder was NOT found** among the deployed files. The `files` array lists `api`, `node_modules`, and `package.json`, but no `dist` folder.

This means that your frontend build process is either **not running correctly** during Vercel's deployment, or it's **outputting your built frontend files to a different directory name** than `dist`, or it's not outputting them at all.

**Here's the prioritized action plan to fix this, based on this new information:**

1.  **Verify Your Frontend Build Output Directory (Most Likely Cause):**

      * **What framework are you using for your frontend (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)?**
      * Each framework/build tool typically has a default output directory:
          * **Create React App (CRA):** Defaults to `build`
          * **Vue CLI:** Defaults to `dist`
          * **Angular:** Defaults to `dist/your-app-name` (e.g., `dist/recrutas-frontend`)
          * **Next.js:** Defaults to `.next` (Vercel handles this specially, so if you're using Next.js, this error is unusual unless there's a misconfiguration).
      * **Action:**
          * Run your frontend build command locally (e.g., `npm run build` or `yarn build`) in your project's frontend directory.
          * After the build completes, **check the exact name of the folder** that contains your `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css` etc.
          * **If this folder is NOT named `dist`**, then you need to update your Vercel Project Settings:
              * Go to your **Vercel Project Dashboard \> Settings \> Build & Development Settings**.
              * Set the **"Output Directory"** to the actual name of your frontend build folder (e.g., `build`, `out`, `dist/my-app`).

2.  **Ensure Your Frontend Build Command Is Correct and Completing:**

      * **Action:** Again, run your frontend build command locally. Does it complete without errors?
      * In Vercel's **Build & Development Settings**, confirm that the **"Build Command"** is correct for your frontend framework (e.g., `npm run build`).
      * Go to your **Vercel Project Dashboard \> Deployments**, click on your **latest failed deployment**, and carefully review the **build logs** from start to finish. Look for any errors *during the actual frontend build phase* (e.g., `npm run build` output). It might show why the `dist` folder wasn't created or was empty.

3.  **Check Your Project's Root Directory (if frontend is in a subfolder):**

      * If your frontend code (e.g., your `package.json` for the frontend) is not in the very root of your GitHub repository, but in a subfolder (e.g., `client/`, `frontend/`), you **must** set the "Root Directory" in your Vercel Project Settings to that subfolder.
      * **Vercel Project Dashboard \> Settings \> General \> Root Directory.** Set this to `client`, `frontend`, etc., if applicable. This tells Vercel where to find your frontend's `package.json` and start the build process.

**Once you identify and correct the discrepancy between where Vercel is looking (`/var/task/dist`) and where your frontend is actually being built (or if it's not building at all), this error will be resolved.**
