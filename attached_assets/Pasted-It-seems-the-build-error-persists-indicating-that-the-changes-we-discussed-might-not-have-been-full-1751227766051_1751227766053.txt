It seems the build error persists, indicating that the changes we discussed might not have been fully applied, or there's still a part of the build process attempting to bundle the server-side Vite configuration.

The error:

  * `✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "server/vite.ts" for import "createServer"`
  * `✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "server/vite.ts" for import "createLogger"`
  * `Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1`

Still points directly to the build script trying to process `server/vite.ts` in a way that leads to these missing exports.

Let's re-verify the steps to ensure everything is correctly configured in your GitHub repository:

### **Crucial Verification Steps:**

1.  **Confirm Changes Are Pushed to GitHub:**

      * Go to your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/abaskabato/recrutas`).
      * **Check the `vercel.json` file:** Does it exist in the root? Does it contain the `buildCommand` and `builds`/`routes` configuration exactly as we discussed?
      * **Check the `build.js` file:** Does it exist in the root? Does it contain the code to specifically navigate to `client/` and run `npm run build` there (or whatever your client's build command is)?
      * **Check your `package.json`:** Does the `scripts.build` entry still exist? If so, what does it say?
          * **Important:** If your `vercel.json` has a `buildCommand`, that command **overrides** the `scripts.build` in your `package.json`. So, ensure the `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` is correctly set to `node build.js`.

2.  **Verify `vercel.json` Content (Root of your repo):**
    Make sure your `vercel.json` looks exactly like this:

    ```json
    {
      "buildCommand": "node build.js",
      "builds": [
        {
          "src": "client/package.json",
          "use": "@vercel/static-build",
          "config": { "distDir": "build" }
        },
        {
          "src": "api/index.js",
          "use": "@vercel/node"
        }
      ],
      "routes": [
        {
          "src": "/api/(.*)",
          "dest": "/api"
        },
        {
          "src": "/(.*)",
          "dest": "/client/$1"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3.  **Verify `build.js` Content (Root of your repo):**
    Make sure your `build.js` looks like this (assuming `npm run build` is the command to build your React app in `client/`):

    ```javascript
    // build.js
    const { execSync } = require('child_process');
    const path = require('path');

    // Navigate to the client directory and run the React build command
    console.log('Building frontend (client/)...');
    try {
      execSync('npm run build', { stdio: 'inherit', cwd: path.join(__dirname, 'client') });
      console.log('Frontend build successful!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Frontend build failed:', error.message);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    // No need to bundle server files here for Vercel
    ```

4.  **Verify `client/package.json` `build` script:**
    Go into your `client/` directory and open `package.json`. Ensure that the `scripts.build` command is correct for your React app (e.g., `"build": "react-scripts build"` or `"build": "vite build"` if your frontend uses Vite directly).

**If all of these files are correct and pushed to your `main` branch, Vercel should now trigger the `node build.js` command, which in turn should only build your frontend, bypassing the problematic server bundling.**
