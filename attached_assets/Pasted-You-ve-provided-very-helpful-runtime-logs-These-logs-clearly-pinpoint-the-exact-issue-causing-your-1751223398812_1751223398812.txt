You've provided very helpful runtime logs\! These logs clearly pinpoint the exact issue causing your Vercel serverless function (specifically `/api/index.js`) to crash:

-----

## The Problem: `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`

This error means your Node.js serverless function is trying to use the CommonJS `require()` syntax, but it's being treated as an ES Module (ECMAScript Module).

Node.js has two module systems:

1.  **CommonJS (CJS):** Uses `require()` for importing modules and `module.exports` for exporting them. This has been the traditional system in Node.js for a long time.
2.  **ES Modules (ESM):** Uses `import` for importing modules and `export` for exporting them. This is the standard module system in modern JavaScript (like what you'd see in browser-side code or modern React/Vue/Angular projects).

The log explicitly states: "This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and `/var/task/package.json` contains `"type": "module"`."

This means your `package.json` file has a top-level `"type": "module"` entry, which tells Node.js (and Vercel's runtime) to treat all `.js` files in your project as ES Modules by default. When it then encounters `require()` in `api/index.js`, it throws a `ReferenceError` because `require` isn't available in ESM scope.

## How to Fix It

You have two primary ways to resolve this, depending on your preference for CommonJS or ES Modules:

### Option 1: Convert Your Serverless Function to Use ES Module Syntax (Recommended for modern Node.js)

This is generally the preferred modern approach for Node.js projects, especially when already using frameworks that favor ESM.

1.  **Replace `require()` with `import` statements:**

      * Find all instances of `require('some-package')` in your `api/index.js` (and any other relevant serverless function files).
      * Change them to `import somePackage from 'some-package';` or `import { namedExport } from 'some-package';`.
      * **Example:**
          * Before: `const express = require('express');`
          * After: `import express from 'express';`
      * **Example for named exports:**
          * Before: `const { json } = require('body-parser');`
          * After: `import { json } from 'body-parser';`

2.  **Replace `module.exports` with `export default` (for the main handler):**

      * If your Vercel function typically exports a handler like `module.exports = (req, res) => { ... };`, you'll need to change it to `export default (req, res) => { ... };`.

    **Example `api/index.js` (simplified):**

    ```javascript
    // Before (CommonJS)
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello from CommonJS!');
    });

    module.exports = app; // Or module.exports = (req, res) => { ... };

    // After (ES Module)
    import express from 'express'; // Use import
    const app = express();

    app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello from ES Module!');
    });

    export default app; // Use export default
    ```

### Option 2: Force Your Serverless Function to be Treated as CommonJS

If you prefer to stick with CommonJS syntax for your serverless functions (e.g., if you have a lot of existing `require` calls and don't want to refactor), you can tell Node.js to treat specific files as CommonJS despite `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.

1.  **Rename your serverless function file:**

      * Rename `api/index.js` to `api/index.cjs`.
      * Do this for any other `.js` serverless function files that are using `require()`.

    The `.cjs` extension explicitly tells Node.js to interpret the file as CommonJS, regardless of the `type` field in `package.json`.

### Next Steps:

1.  **Choose one of the two options above.**
2.  **Make the necessary code changes** in your `api/index.js` (or `.cjs`) file and any other affected serverless function files.
3.  **Commit your changes** to your GitHub repository.
4.  **Push the changes** to GitHub. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment.
5.  **Monitor the Vercel logs** for the new deployment to confirm the `ReferenceError` is gone and your functions are executing successfully.

This `ReferenceError` is a very common issue when migrating or mixing Node.js module syntaxes, but thankfully, it's quite straightforward to fix once you understand the cause\!
