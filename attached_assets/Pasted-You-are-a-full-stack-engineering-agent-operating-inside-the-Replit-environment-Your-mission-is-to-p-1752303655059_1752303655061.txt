You are a full-stack engineering agent operating inside the Replit environment. Your mission is to perform a complete end-to-end review of the Recrutas project, identifying and resolving any broken or incomplete behaviors without introducing new features. Focus on auditing existing functionality, especially areas related to authentication, dashboard routing, and button actions.

üß≠ Context:
- Codebase is mostly complete and reflects current GitHub state (used to deploy to Vercel).
- Git pushes are done manually ‚Äî no automated deployment.
- Replit environment works for login, but sign-out, sign-up, and dashboard access are failing or inconsistent.
- Better Auth integration must remain untouched.

üîç Objectives:
1. **Authentication Review**:
   - Inspect the sign-out logic ‚Äî determine why it doesn‚Äôt clear session or redirect.
   - Review sign-up flow ‚Äî check for frontend submission issues or backend routing failures.
   - Ensure both flows work reliably across Replit and Vercel.

2. **Dashboard Role-Based Routing**:
   - Validate session correctly identifies and routes users to either:
     - Candidate Dashboard
     - Talent Owner Dashboard
   - Check conditional logic used for role separation and interface rendering.

3. **Button Functionality Audit**:
   - For **both dashboards**, inspect all buttons:
     - Confirm proper handlers are attached
     - Ensure expected backend actions are triggered
     - Verify that route changes occur as expected
   - Pay close attention to buttons tied to application flow, profile editing, communication features, and analytics.

4. **Environment Behavior Analysis**:
   - Check for Replit-specific assumptions that break in Vercel:
     - Cookie scope and persistence
     - CORS policies
     - OAuth redirect URI mismatches
     - `.env` variable loading across environments

5. **Preserve All Existing Modules**:
   - Do not overwrite or refactor:
     - Job matching, aggregation, filtering
     - Custom exams and Pass-to-Chat logic
     - WebSocket messaging and notification system
     - Resume parsing and profile optimization
     - Analytics and market insights
     - Behavioral matching engine

üéØ Final Output:
- A complete diagnostic log of issues found
- Inline code comments if changes are required
- A Git commit message suggestion (e.g. `fix: restore dashboard buttons and auth flow`)
- A checklist for Vercel validation including:
  - Successful sign-in and sign-out
  - Reliable sign-up routing and confirmation
  - Functional buttons and dashboards per role

üõ°Ô∏è Directive:
Do not introduce new features. Do not modify Better Auth. Work only within the scope of the current codebase to restore missing or broken functionality across environments.
