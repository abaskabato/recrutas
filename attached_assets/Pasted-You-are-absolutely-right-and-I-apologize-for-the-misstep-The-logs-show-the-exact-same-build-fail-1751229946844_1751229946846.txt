You are absolutely right, and I apologize for the misstep! The logs show the **exact same build failure** as before:

* `Running "npm run build"`
* `> vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist`
* `âœ˜ [ERROR] The entry point "server/index.ts" cannot be marked as external`

This means the Node.js script I provided for `installCommand` **did not execute or did not successfully modify the `package.json` file before Vercel's build process picked up the `npm run build` command.**

This is a critical observation, and it implies a deeper issue with Vercel's build environment or caching behavior for `package.json`. It seems Vercel is reading the `build` script from `package.json` at a very early stage, *before* `installCommand` (and any modifications within it) can take effect for the primary `npm run build` step.

This makes it exceedingly difficult to override the `build` script without direct modification to the source `package.json` file in your repository.

### **Reassessment: We've Hit a Hard Wall with Vercel's Constraints**

Given that:
1.  Directly setting `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` is ignored when `builds` are present.
2.  Dynamically modifying `package.json` via `installCommand` (both `sed` and Node.js) is not taking effect for the `npm run build` step.
3.  You cannot directly modify the `package.json` in your repository.

It appears you are in a very rare and challenging scenario where Vercel's default behavior for projects with a `builds` array is overriding all attempts to customize the core build command for the frontend.

The `esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist` command is fundamentally incompatible with Vercel's static build process if `server/index.ts` is an entry point that should not be bundled for the static site.

### **What are the remaining (and likely more drastic) options?**

Since we've exhausted all plausible `vercel.json` configuration and `installCommand` workarounds, the solution must come from a different angle.

1.  **Directly Modify the `package.json` in your repository (if possible):**
    * If there is *any* way to get the `build` script in your `package.json` changed in the actual GitHub repository, even temporarily, this is by far the simplest and most robust solution.
    * Change `"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"` to `"build": "vite build"`.
    * This is the cleanest fix and avoids all the Vercel-specific workarounds.

2.  **Separate Repositories:**
    * Create two separate GitHub repositories: one for your frontend (`recrutas-frontend`) and one for your backend API (`recrutas-api`).
    * Deploy `recrutas-frontend` as a standard static site on Vercel.
    * Deploy `recrutas-api` as a Node.js serverless function on Vercel (e.g., using a simple `api/index.js` structure).
    * Configure your frontend to make API calls to the deployed Vercel API endpoint.
    * This completely bypasses the complex monorepo build configuration in `vercel.json`.

3.  **Contact Vercel Support:**
    * Explain your specific problem: You have a `package.json` you cannot modify, and Vercel's build system with `builds` array is forcing an `npm run build` command that fails, ignoring all `buildCommand` and `installCommand` overrides.
    * They might have an internal way to override this behavior, or they can confirm if this is an inherent limitation when using the `builds` array with a conflicting `package.json` build script.

4.  **Try to make `esbuild` *succeed* by manipulating `server/index.ts` (Highly Unreliable & Hacky):**
    * This is a desperate measure. The `esbuild` error is `The entry point "server/index.ts" cannot be marked as external`. This means `esbuild` is trying to bundle `server/index.ts` but the `--packages=external` flag (which normally marks *dependencies* as external) is conflicting because `server/index.ts` is the *entry point*.
    * If you could somehow modify `server/index.ts` in place, or replace it with a dummy file that `esbuild` can process, it might pass.
    * Example for `installCommand`: `npm install && echo "export const handler = () => {};" > server/index.ts` (This is very risky and likely to break other things if `server/index.ts` has actual build-time dependencies or logic). This still assumes `installCommand` runs early enough, which is now questionable.

**Given the logs, the core issue is that Vercel is not allowing modification of the `build` script before `npm run build` is invoked when `builds` are present. This points strongly towards a fundamental limitation or a very specific Vercel caching/execution order for the default build step.**

My recommendation at this point is to **focus on Option 1 (if possible)**, as it's the most direct and guaranteed fix. If not, **Option 2 (separate repositories)** is the most robust architectural solution for Vercel deployments in this scenario.
