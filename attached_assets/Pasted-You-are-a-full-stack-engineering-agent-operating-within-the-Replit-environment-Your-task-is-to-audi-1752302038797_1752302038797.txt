You are a full-stack engineering agent operating within the Replit environment. Your task is to audit, diagnose, and fix any discrepancies in the Recrutas project ‚Äî specifically issues affecting authentication (sign-in and sign-up) in its deployed Vercel app, triggered manually via GitHub pushes.

üìç Context:
- The Replit local environment contains the latest code.
- The GitHub repo, which mirrors this code, is used for manual deployment to Vercel.
- Most features are working as intended locally.
- Authentication previously worked in Replit but broke after code changes intended to support Vercel.

üîç Your Mission:
1. **Audit the Current Codebase**:
   - Do not add or rewrite any feature code.
   - Thoroughly inspect all existing logic related to authentication: OAuth configuration, session management, redirect URIs, cookie handling, and environment variables.
   - Cross-reference any changes made to accommodate Vercel deployment.

2. **Diagnose the Root Causes**:
   - Identify why sign-in and sign-up flows fail in Vercel.
   - Pay particular attention to:
     - CORS errors
     - Cookie scope/domain mismatches (especially with HTTPS)
     - Redirect URI misalignment with OAuth providers
     - Missing or misconfigured `.env.production` values
     - Replit-specific assumptions that don‚Äôt hold on Vercel

3. **Button Integrity Check**:
   - Inspect dashboard buttons for both roles ‚Äî **candidate** and **talent owner**.
   - Ensure buttons trigger intended routes and backend actions correctly.
   - Validate that access control restrictions are enforced based on role and session.

4. **Preserve Feature Integrity**:
   - Maintain all existing modules:
     - Job matching, aggregation, filtering
     - Exams, Pass-to-Chat gatekeeping
     - Real-time WebSocket messaging
     - Resume parsing and optimization
     - Analytics, dashboards, and cognitive profiling
     - Role-based interface separation

5. **Fix Plan & Git Commit Prep**:
   - Propose minimal code edits needed to restore authentication across environments
   - Document any changes and add inline comments explaining environment-specific behavior
   - Suggest a clean, descriptive Git commit message (e.g. `fix: restore cross-env auth`)
   - Create a checklist for post-deployment validation on Vercel:
     - OAuth redirect URIs match deployed domain
     - Cookies function securely over HTTPS
     - All necessary environment variables are set in Vercel's dashboard
     - Dashboard buttons behave as expected for both roles

üõ°Ô∏è Directive:
Preserve the integrity of the Better Auth system at all costs ‚Äî do not replace or rewrite it. Your objective is compatibility and stability, not reinvention.

üéØ Final Output:
A locally working Replit version of Recrutas ready for Git push to GitHub, that will deploy to Vercel with fully restored and functional authentication, dashboard behavior, and user role logic.
