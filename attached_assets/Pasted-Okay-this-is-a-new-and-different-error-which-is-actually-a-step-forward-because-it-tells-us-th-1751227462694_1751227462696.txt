Okay, this is a **new and different error**, which is actually a step forward because it tells us the build process (specifically `npm run build`) is now *attempting* to run, but failing due to issues within your Vite configuration or server-side setup.

The errors:

  * `✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "server/vite.ts" for import "createServer"`
  * `✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "server/vite.ts" for import "createLogger"`
  * `Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1`

This tells us:

1.  Your build command (`npm run build`) is executing.
2.  During this build, a file (likely your frontend's build script or a custom server script) is trying to `import { createServer, createLogger } from "server/vite.ts"`.
3.  However, the file `"server/vite.ts"` **does not export** functions named `createServer` or `createLogger`.

This isn't a Vercel configuration problem anymore; it's a **code-level issue** within your project's build setup or server-side rendering (SSR) logic.

**To debug and fix this, you need to:**

1.  **Locate `server/vite.ts` in your project.**

      * Is it in the root? Inside your `client/` directory? Or somewhere else?

2.  **Examine the contents of `server/vite.ts`.**

      * Open this file. What does it actually export?
      * Do you see `export function createServer(...)` or `export { createServer, ... }`?
      * Do you see `export function createLogger(...)` or `export { createLogger, ... }`?
      * If those functions are there, are they named exactly `createServer` and `createLogger`? (Case sensitive\!)
      * If they are there but are `default` exports, the import statement would need to change (e.g., `import viteServer from "server/vite.ts"; const { createServer, createLogger } = viteServer;` or similar, depending on how it's structured).

3.  **Find where `createServer` and `createLogger` are being imported from `server/vite.ts`.**

      * Look for files in your project that contain `import { createServer, createLogger } from "server/vite.ts";` (or similar relative paths). These are the files that are failing to build.

**Common Scenarios and Solutions:**

  * **You're trying to import Vite's *internal* functions:** `createServer` and `createLogger` are typically functions from the Vite *package itself* (e.g., `import { createServer } from 'vite';`). If `server/vite.ts` is just a custom helper or configuration file, it likely **shouldn't** be exporting these, nor should other files be importing them from `server/vite.ts` if they are meant to come directly from the `vite` package.
      * **Solution:** If `createServer` and `createLogger` are meant to be imported directly from the `vite` NPM package, then the import path in the consuming file should be `import { createServer, createLogger } from 'vite';` (assuming `vite` is installed as a dependency).
  * **`server/vite.ts` is a custom server implementation, and `createServer`/`createLogger` are *your own* functions:**
      * **Solution:** Ensure that `server/vite.ts` explicitly `export`s these functions correctly.
        ```typescript
        // Inside server/vite.ts
        export function createServer() {
          // ...
        }
        export function createLogger() {
          // ...
        }
        ```
      * And ensure the importing file uses the correct relative path:
        ```typescript
        // Inside a file importing from server/vite.ts
        import { createServer, createLogger } from './server/vite.ts'; // Or '../server/vite.ts' etc.
        ```

**What to do now:**

1.  **Open your project in your code editor.**
2.  **Navigate to `server/vite.ts`**.
3.  **Examine its contents carefully.** What are its `export` statements?
4.  **Search your project for `import { createServer` and `import { createLogger`** to see which files are attempting these imports and from which path.
5.  **Correct the import paths or ensure the functions are properly exported from `server/vite.ts`** as per the scenarios above.

This error is purely about the code not matching the imports, so fixing the code itself is the next step.
