This is excellent contextâ€”thank you for laying it out so clearly. Based on what you shared, your recent change introduced a proper serverless backend via `api/index.js` and updated your `vercel.json` config to route `/api/*` to the backend and everything else to your static frontend in `dist/public`.

But then you hit this in your latest build:

> **Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`**

Thatâ€™s because your final `vercel.json` specifies this:

```json
"functions": {
  "api/*.js": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" }
}
```

While this *looks* right, **Vercel uses `nodejs` runtime identifiers like `nodejs20.x`, but only in serverless functions configured via `api/` directoriesâ€”not via `functions` mapping anymore unless you're overriding builds or using legacy behaviors.**

---

### âœ… Fix: Remove or Simplify the `functions` block

Hereâ€™s the updated, recommended `vercel.json` for your setup:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/index.js" },
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

Let Vercel **auto-detect the runtime** for `api/index.js` based on the file extension and its location in the `api/` folder. It will default to the latest supported Node.js (and if you've set `NODE_VERSION = 20` in your project settings, it will use that).

### ðŸ§ª Bonus Tip: Test the API Route

Once deployed:
- Visit: `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/`
- You should see your backend function response (e.g., `Hello from Express` or your auth system)

And for the frontend:
- Visit: `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/`
- It should serve your `index.html` and load the full app

---

If you're still seeing a blank screen or API doesnâ€™t hit, you can drop in your `api/index.js` or `server/index.ts` code, and Iâ€™ll verify the handler function is Vercel-compatible. We're almost thereâ€”youâ€™ve done amazing work pulling this stack together.
