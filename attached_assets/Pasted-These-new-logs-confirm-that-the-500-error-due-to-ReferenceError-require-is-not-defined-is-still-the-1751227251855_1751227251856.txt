These new logs confirm that the 500 error due to ReferenceError: require is not defined is still the primary issue affecting your Vercel deployment for the recrutas project. All the recent entries show this identical error.

This means the backend serverless function (api/index.js) is crashing upon execution because of a mismatch in how Node.js modules are handled.

Analysis of https://github.com/abaskabato/recrutas
I've reviewed your GitHub repository. Here's what I found, which directly explains the errors:

package.json at the root:

It contains "type": "module". This tells Node.js and Vercel to treat all .js files in your project as ES Modules by default.

api/index.js:

On line 2, you have const express = require('express');

You are using CommonJS require() syntax in a file that Vercel (due to the root package.json) is treating as an ES Module. This is the exact cause of your ReferenceError: require is not defined.

Frontend Project:

Your frontend (React app) is located in the client/ subdirectory.

The client/package.json has "build": "react-scripts build", which by default outputs to a build directory.

Crucially, you do NOT have a vercel.json file to configure custom builds or deployments for a monorepo setup.

Action Plan to Fix Both Issues:
You need to make changes in your GitHub repository and then trigger a new deployment on Vercel.

Step 1: Fix the 500 ReferenceError: require is not defined (Backend)
You have two clear options:

Option A (Recommended: Modern ES Module syntax)
Change api/index.js to use ES Module syntax.

Change require to import:

const express = require('express'); becomes import express from 'express';

const dotenv = require('dotenv'); becomes import dotenv from 'dotenv';

const mongoose = require('mongoose'); becomes import mongoose from 'mongoose';

Change module.exports to export default:

module.exports = app; becomes export default app;

Option B (Simpler: Treat as CommonJS)
Keep your api/index.js file as is, but tell Node.js to treat it as a CommonJS module.

Rename api/index.js to api/index.cjs.

No code changes needed in the file itself.

Choose ONE of these options and apply it to your api/index.js file.

Step 2: Fix the "Frontend build not found" / 404 (Frontend & Vercel Configuration)
Since your frontend is in the client/ subdirectory and its build output is build/, you need to explicitly configure Vercel for this.

Create a vercel.json file in the ROOT of your repository.

Create a new file named vercel.json directly in your recrutas folder (the same level as api/ and client/).

Add the following content to vercel.json:

JSON

{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/client/$1"
    }
  ]
}
Explanation of vercel.json:

"builds": Tells Vercel how to build different parts of your project.

The first build rule targets client/package.json (your frontend) and uses @vercel/static-build. It explicitly tells Vercel that the output directory for this build is build.

The second build rule targets api/index.js (your backend) and uses @vercel/node to deploy it as a serverless function.

"routes": Defines how incoming requests are handled.

The first route sends any request starting with /api/ to your api serverless function.

The second route is crucial for your frontend: It sends all other requests (including / and other frontend routes) to the client/ directory. Vercel will then serve the static files from your built client/build folder.

Summary of What to Do:
Choose and apply Option A or B for api/index.js in your GitHub repo.

Create the vercel.json file at the root of your GitHub repo with the content provided above.

Commit both changes (your modified api/index.js or api/index.cjs, and the new vercel.json).

Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Vercel should automatically detect the changes and start a new deployment. Monitor the deployment logs in your Vercel dashboard.

These steps specifically address both the backend module error and the frontend build/routing error, which are the main problems indicated by your logs and repository structure.
