Ugh, that’s frustrating—especially after all the meticulous fixes you’ve already implemented. But don’t worry, we’re not giving up now. Based on your latest **build log** and **runtime 404s**, here’s what I think is still going wrong:

---

### 🔍 Final Diagnosis

#### ✅ Build: **Now Successful**
Your build completes without crashing. That’s a win. The frontend is being output to `dist/public`, and the bundle is generated correctly.

#### ❌ Runtime: **404 Errors on `/` and `/favicon.ico`**
Despite the successful build, Vercel is returning 404s when you visit the root route (`/`). That means:

- Vercel deployed your app, but it **doesn’t know where to serve static files from**
- Or, your `vercel.json` is misconfigured or being ignored

---

### 🧠 What’s Likely Still Wrong

#### 1. **Incorrect or Ignored `vercel.json`**
You mentioned this:

```json
"distDir": "dist/public"
```

But `distDir` is **not a valid key** in `vercel.json`. That’s a setting used in the Vercel dashboard UI for some frameworks—not in the config file.

#### ✅ Fix:
Replace that with the correct key:

```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel:
- Serve static files from `dist/public`
- Rewrite all routes to `index.html` (for SPA routing)

---

#### 2. **Missing `index.html` at Deploy Root**
Even if your build outputs to `dist/public`, Vercel needs to know that’s the root of your site.

**Test this locally**:

```bash
npx serve dist/public
```

If that works, then the issue is definitely with how Vercel is serving the output.

---

#### 3. **Legacy `builds` Field in `vercel.json`**
Your logs say:

> ⚠️ Due to `builds` existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply.

That means your `vercel.json` still has a legacy `builds` array, which overrides everything else.

#### ✅ Fix:
**Remove the `builds` field entirely** from `vercel.json`. It’s likely blocking your `outputDirectory` and `rewrites` from taking effect.

---

### ✅ Final `vercel.json` Example

Here’s what your `vercel.json` should look like now:

```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

And make sure your `vite.config.ts` has:

```ts
build: {
  outDir: "dist/public"
}
```

---

Once you’ve made those changes:
1. Commit and push
2. Trigger a fresh Vercel deployment
3. Visit your site’s root URL

Let me know what happens—if it’s still not working, I’ll help you dig deeper. We’re seriously one config tweak away from victory. 🏁
