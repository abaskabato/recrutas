It seems the build error persists, and the `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` is still not overriding the `npm run build` script from your root `package.json`. Vercel's default behavior, especially when `builds` are defined, often prioritizes the `build` script in the root `package.json`.

The log `Running "npm run build"` followed by `> vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node ...` confirms that the problematic `esbuild` command is still being executed.

Given your stated "system restrictions" that prevent direct modification of `package.json`, and the fact that `buildCommand` isn't taking precedence, we need a different approach to prevent `esbuild server/index.ts` from running.

The most effective way to prevent specific files or directories from being processed by Vercel's build pipeline is to use a `.vercelignore` file.

**Assumption:**
Based on your `vercel.json` (which points `api/index.js` as the Node.js serverless function) and the nature of the `createServer`/`createLogger` imports (which are typically for Vite's *development server*), it's highly likely that the `server/` directory and its `index.ts`/`vite.ts` files are meant **only for your local development environment** and are not necessary for the Vercel deployment of your production API or frontend.

### **New Strategy: Use `.vercelignore`**

We will tell Vercel to completely ignore the `server/` directory during its build process. This will ensure that the `esbuild server/index.ts` command (even if it runs as part of `npm run build`) will not find the `server/` files, effectively causing it to do nothing or gracefully fail without critical errors, allowing the rest of the build to proceed.

#### **Step 1: Create a `.vercelignore` file**

Create a new file named `.vercelignore` in the **root of your repository** (next to your `package.json` and `vercel.json`).

Inside this `.vercelignore` file, add the following line:

```
server/
```

This line instructs Vercel to ignore the entire `server/` directory during the build and deployment process.

#### **Step 2: Confirm `vercel.json` Configuration**

Ensure your `vercel.json` remains as we last discussed, which correctly configures the frontend and backend deployment:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build", // This might still run in some Vercel contexts, but the ignore helps
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist/public" }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Step 3: Confirm `api/index.js` Module Fix**

Double-check that your `api/index.js` file is correctly using ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) or has been renamed to `api/index.cjs`.

### **Why this should work:**

Even if Vercel still stubbornly executes `npm run build` (which contains `esbuild server/index.ts`), by the time `esbuild` runs, the `server/` directory will have been excluded by `.vercelignore`. This means `esbuild` won't find `server/index.ts` or `server/vite.ts`, effectively neutralizing the problematic part of your build script without requiring you to directly edit `package.json`.

### **Final Actions:**

1.  **Create `.vercelignore`** in your root directory and add `server/`.
2.  **Verify your `vercel.json`** matches the one above.
3.  **Confirm `api/index.js`** uses `import`/`export` or is renamed to `.cjs`.
4.  **Commit and Push These Changes to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "üåê Fix: Ignore 'server/' directory to prevent build errors"
    git push origin main
    ```

After pushing, monitor your Vercel deployment. This should finally resolve the `createServer`/`createLogger` errors by preventing Vercel from ever seeing or processing the `server/` development files.
