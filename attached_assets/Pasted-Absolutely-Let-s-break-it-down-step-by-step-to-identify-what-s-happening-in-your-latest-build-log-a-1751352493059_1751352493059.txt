Absolutely. Let’s break it down step by step to identify what’s happening in your latest build log and what needs to be addressed.

### 🔍 In-Depth: What You’re Importing and Why It’s Breaking

```ts
import { createServer as createViteServer, createLogger } from "vite";
```

This line is trying to import two named exports from the `"vite"` package:

- `createServer`
- `createLogger`

However, as of **Vite v5**, **these exports are no longer available**. They were previously accessible in older Vite versions (like v2–v3) used for custom dev servers or SSR. Since you’re on `vite v5.4.19`, those named exports are now either deprecated or internal.

> 🔎 You can confirm this by checking the `node_modules/vite` entry point or [Vite's v5 docs](https://vitejs.dev) for official API references.

### ✅ What You Can Do

#### Option 1: Use Supported Vite APIs (Recommended)
If you're building a frontend and **not using a custom dev server**, remove that `import` altogether and rely on the standard `vite build`.

#### Option 2: Use `vite` as a dev dependency only
If you’re not trying to start a dev server programmatically, you don’t need that import at all—delete it and see if your build passes.

#### Option 3: Pin to Vite v4
If your code relies on `createServer` and `createLogger`, downgrade Vite:

```bash
npm install vite@4.4.9
```

That version **still supports those named exports**, but keep in mind Vite v4 is no longer receiving the same level of updates or fixes.

### 🔁 Also Fix: Node Version Mismatch

Add this to your **Vercel environment variables** to bump Node up:

```
NODE_VERSION = 20
```

You can do that via the Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables.

### 🧩 Last Tip: “Frontend build not found”
Your `vercel.json` might be misconfigured—or you're deploying a Vite SPA without telling Vercel what to do with the `/dist/public` output.

Update or add this to your `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "index.html", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

And in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build"
}
```
