Thanks for hanging in there—based on everything you've shared, here's a clear breakdown of what’s going wrong and how to fix it:

---

### 🧨 The Two Core Problems

#### 1. **Build Fails Due to Invalid Vite Imports**
Your build log shows:

```
[ERROR] No matching export in "vite" for import "createServer" and "createLogger"
```

You're trying to do this:

```ts
import { createServer as createViteServer, createLogger } from "vite";
```

But in **Vite v5.4.19**, those exports no longer exist. This is a breaking change from earlier versions.

#### ✅ Fix:
- **If you don’t need those functions**, remove the import line entirely.
- **If you do need them**, downgrade Vite to a version that still supports them:

```bash
npm install vite@4.4.9
```

---

#### 2. **Runtime 404 Errors**
Your runtime logs show repeated 404s on `/`, `/favicon.ico`, etc. That means Vercel deployed your app, but it doesn’t know where to find your frontend files.

#### ✅ Fix:
Update your `vercel.json` to point to the correct output directory:

```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

Also, make sure your `vite.config.ts` includes:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outDir: "dist/public"
  }
});
```

And your `package.json` has:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build"
}
```

### ⚠️ Bonus: Node Version Mismatch

You're using `@simplewebauthn/server@13.1.1`, which requires Node **≥20**, but Vercel is using **v18.20.6**.

#### ✅ Fix:
In your Vercel dashboard, go to **Project Settings → Environment Variables**, and add:

```
NODE_VERSION = 20
```

Or create `.vercel/project.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultEnvironment": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "20"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Final Checklist

| ✅ Task | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Remove or fix invalid Vite imports | 🔧 Required |
| Set correct `outputDirectory` in `vercel.json` | 🔧 Required |
| Ensure `vite.config.ts` outputs to `dist/public` | 🔧 Required |
| Set `NODE_VERSION = 20` | 🔧 Required |
| Add a favicon to avoid 404s (optional) | 🎨 Nice to have |

Once you apply these, your build should succeed and your app should serve correctly on Vercel. Want me to help rewrite any of those files? Just drop them in—I’ve got your back.
