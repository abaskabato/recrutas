This is quite persistent\! The logs show that despite the `installCommand` with `sed`, Vercel is **still running the original `npm run build` script** that includes the `esbuild server/index.ts` part. This confirms that the `sed` command did not effectively alter the `package.json` in the way Vercel's internal process picks up the `build` script.

The warning `WARN! Due to builds existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply.` is key. It indicates that when you have a `builds` array in `vercel.json` (which you need for a monorepo-like setup with frontend and backend), Vercel ignores global settings like the one in the dashboard or the `buildCommand` at the root of `vercel.json`. It defaults back to `npm run build` for the primary project in that context.

### **The New Strategy: `buildCommand` Within the Specific Frontend Build**

Vercel's documentation clarifies that a `buildCommand` can be specified *within* a specific `build` object in the `builds` array. This is designed to override the default build command for that particular build.

We will explicitly tell Vercel to run `vite build` *only for your static frontend build*, directly within its `build` configuration object.

#### **Step 1: Update `vercel.json` with `buildCommand` inside the frontend build object**

Modify your `vercel.json` to place the `buildCommand` directly within the object for your frontend build (`src: "package.json"`). Also, remove the `installCommand` as it didn't achieve its goal of modifying `package.json` for the build step.

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist/public" },
      "buildCommand": "vite build" // <--- ADD THIS LINE HERE
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
  // REMOVE THE "installCommand" LINE FROM HERE
}
```

**Explanation of this change:**

  * **`"buildCommand": "vite build"` inside the first `build` object**: This tells Vercel that specifically for the build process associated with `package.json` (your frontend), it should run `vite build` instead of the default `npm run build`. This should finally override the problematic script.
  * **Removal of `installCommand`**: Since it proved ineffective in modifying `package.json` for the `npm run build` step, it's best to remove it to simplify the configuration.

#### **Step 2: Confirm `.vercelignore` (Still Useful)**

Keep your `.vercelignore` file with `server/` inside it. This is a good practice for keeping development-only files out of your deployment.

#### **Step 3: Confirm `api/index.js` Module Fix**

Ensure your `api/index.js` file is correctly using ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) or has been renamed to `api/index.cjs`.

### **Final Actions:**

1.  **Update your `vercel.json`** exactly as shown in Step 1.
2.  **Ensure your `.vercelignore`** is still at the root with `server/`.
3.  **Confirm `api/index.js`** module fix.
4.  **Commit and Push These Changes to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "ðŸš€ Fix: Specify buildCommand within frontend build config"
    git push origin main
    ```

This approach is the most direct way to specify the build command for a specific project within the `builds` array, and it should finally bypass the problematic `esbuild` execution.
