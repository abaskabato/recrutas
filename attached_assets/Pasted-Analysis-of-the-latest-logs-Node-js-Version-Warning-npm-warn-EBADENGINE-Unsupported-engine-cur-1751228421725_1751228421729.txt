Analysis of the latest logs:

Node.js Version Warning: npm warn EBADENGINE Unsupported engine... current: { node: 'v18.20.6', npm: '10.8.2' }

This is a warning, not an error. Your @simplewebauthn/server package recommends Node.js 20+, but Vercel is currently using 18. This won't stop the build or deployment, but it's something to keep in mind for future updates or if you encounter runtime issues specific to Node 18 vs 20.

Vercel's Build Command: Running "npm run build"

This is the key! Despite our previous attempts to use buildCommand in vercel.json or a custom build.js, Vercel is still defaulting to running the build script defined in your root package.json. This is why the problem persists.

The problematic build script:

> rest-express@1.0.0 build

> vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist

This line confirms the issue. Your root package.json's build script is doing two things:

vite build: This successfully builds your frontend (client/) as shown by the ✓ built in 6.94s and the generated index.html, .css, and .js files. This part is working.

&& esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist: This is the culprit. You are attempting to bundle your server/index.ts file using esbuild. The errors No matching export in "server/vite.ts" for import "createServer" arise because server/index.ts (or something it imports, like server/vite.ts) is trying to use development-specific features of Vite (createServer, createLogger) that are not meant for a simple serverless bundle, and esbuild is failing to resolve them in this context.

The core issue is that you do not need to manually esbuild your server/index.ts (or api/index.js) for Vercel. Vercel's @vercel/node builder automatically handles the bundling and deployment of your api/index.js file as a serverless function based on your vercel.json's builds configuration. Attempting to manually esbuild a server file that contains Vite development utilities is causing the build to fail.

Action Plan to Fix Both Issues (Combined Deployment):
We need to fix both the require error for the API and the frontend build process.

Step 1: Fix ReferenceError: require is not defined in api/index.js (Backend)
This still appears in older logs, so ensure it's fixed in your main branch. Choose ONE of these and apply it to api/index.js:

Option 1 (Recommended): Convert to ES Modules.

Change const express = require('express'); to import express from 'express';

Change const dotenv = require('dotenv'); to import dotenv from 'dotenv';

Change const mongoose = require('mongoose'); to import mongoose from 'mongoose';

Change module.exports = app; to export default app;

Crucially, convert all other require() calls in api/index.js to import statements.

Option 2 (Simpler but less modern): Rename api/index.js to api/index.cjs.

No code changes needed inside the file itself.

Step 2: Correct Your Root package.json build Script (Frontend Build)
This is the most critical fix for the current errors.

Open your root package.json file (not the client/package.json).

Find the "scripts" section.

Change your "build" script to only build the frontend.

JSON

{
  "name": "rest-express",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "concurrently \"vite\" \"nodemon index.js\"",
    "build": "vite build", // <-- CHANGE THIS LINE
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  // ... rest of your package.json ...
}
By changing "build": "vite build", you are instructing the script to only run the Vite build for your frontend. The problematic esbuild server/index.ts ... part is completely removed.

Step 3: Ensure vercel.json is Correct for Combined Deployment
Confirm your vercel.json in the root of your repository is configured as follows to deploy both:

JSON

{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/client/$1"
    }
  ]
}
Note: We are not using buildCommand here, as Vercel is overriding it by running npm run build from your package.json. By fixing that npm run build script directly, we solve the problem.

Summary of What to Do:
Fix api/index.js: Implement Option 1 (ESM import/export) or Option 2 (rename to .cjs).

Edit Root package.json: Change the scripts.build line to "build": "vite build".

Verify vercel.json: Ensure it's in the root and matches the structure above.

Commit and Push These Changes:

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "✅ Fix: Clean build script & Module import issue"
git push origin main
This approach directly targets the source of the createServer/createLogger errors by modifying the npm run build script and ensures your api/index.js is also correctly handled.
