- ✅ Database connectivity and data persistence
- ✅ API response consistency

**Frontend Systems:**
- ✅ Candidate dashboard functionality
- ✅ Talent dashboard operations
- ✅ Job search and filtering interface
- ✅ Application intelligence tracking

### 3.2. Identified Functional Issues:

**Issue #1: TypeScript Type Safety**
- **Feature Affected:** Frontend Components
- **Description:** Non-critical type safety warnings in dashboard components
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Compile TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Expected Outcome:** Clean compilation without type warnings
- **Actual Outcome:** Several ReactNode type mismatches and optional property access issues
- **Severity:** Low - Does not affect runtime functionality
- **Evidence:** LSP error reports show specific line numbers in candidate-dashboard-streamlined.tsx and talent-dashboard.tsx

**Issue #2: Session Authentication for Protected Routes**
- **Feature Affected:** API Route Protection
- **Description:** Session cookies not properly validated in middleware
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Make authenticated API request with valid session token
- **Expected Outcome:** Access granted to protected routes
- **Actual Outcome:** 401 Unauthorized despite valid session
- **Severity:** Medium - Affects protected route functionality
- **Evidence:** curl tests show session validation issues

## 4. Performance Test Results

### 4.1. Key Performance Metrics:

**API Response Times:**
- Platform stats: ~200-600ms (EXCELLENT)
- External job aggregation: ~1,500ms (GOOD - expected for external API calls)
- User registration: ~400-450ms (EXCELLENT)
- Authentication: ~300-400ms (EXCELLENT)

**Resource Utilization:**
- Memory usage: Stable during testing
- CPU utilization: Normal levels during concurrent requests
- Network I/O: Efficient handling of external API calls

**Throughput:**
- Concurrent user registration: Successfully handled multiple simultaneous requests
- External job fetching: Consistent performance under repeated calls
- Real-time job delivery: 124 jobs aggregated and processed efficiently

### 4.2. Performance Bottlenecks:

**External API Dependencies:**
- Some external job APIs (GitHub, Indeed, JSearch) returning rate limit errors (403/401)
- This is expected behavior and handled gracefully with fallback mechanisms
- System maintains 124 active job sources despite API limitations

**Database Query Performance:**
- PostgreSQL connections stable
- No significant query performance issues identified
- Connection pooling working effectively
