# Recrutas Investment Memo (Draft)

*Generated Feb 2026 — for future pitch prep*

## Mission

Candidate-first platform where every job application gets a response. Internal jobs: same-day status via exam-based auto-filtering. External jobs: guaranteed fresh, real, and actively hiring.

Core promise: **"Apply here, know where you stand — today."**

## Market Reality (2025-2026)

- Ghost jobs estimated at 20-40% of listings
- Average application gets zero response 75%+ of the time
- AI mass-apply tools (LazyApply, Sonara) increased volume, destroyed signal on both sides
- Recruiters drowning in low-intent applications
- Market is structurally broken: volume destroyed signal

## The Bet

Opposite direction from the market. Less volume, higher signal.

- Fewer jobs shown (verified, fresh, US-only, skill-matched, non-ghost)
- Higher quality applications (exam-gated for internal, curated for external)
- Guaranteed closure (same-day status on internal, freshness guarantee on external)

**Contrarian bet: the market needs less volume and more accountability.**

## Strengths

- Internal exam flow is genuinely novel — deterministic, no recruiter bottleneck, same-day status
- Technical execution: 94 company scrapers, ghost detection, liveness checks, hiring.cafe integration, company verification
- Timing: post-AI-spam backlash creates demand for quality over quantity
- The response guarantee backed by exam infrastructure is operationally hard to copy

## Key Questions Investors Will Ask

### 1. Cold Start / GTM
**Q**: Two-sided marketplace — who comes first?
**A**: External job aggregation is the wedge. Candidates come for curated external feed (zero recruiter dependency). Once candidate volume exists, pitch recruiters: "10,000 active candidates with skill assessments. Post here, get pre-filtered applicants."

### 2. Defensibility
**Q**: Scraping + matching is replicable. What's the moat?
**A**: The exam-based response guarantee requires rethinking the entire recruiter workflow. Indeed/LinkedIn can't do this without alienating paying customers (recruiters who want optionality to ghost). Operational moat, not technical.

### 3. Revenue Model
**Q**: Who pays?
**A**: Free for candidates. Charge recruiters for pre-assessed talent pipeline with guaranteed SLA. "We did the screening, here are your top 5, you respond today or get deprioritized."

### 4. Can You Deliver "Every Application Gets a Response" at Scale?
**A**: Internal — yes (exam is deterministic). External — honest version is "every job here is real and actively hiring" (freshness/quality promise, not response promise). Don't overpromise on external.

## Scoring

| Factor | Score | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Problem severity | 9/10 | Universal pain point |
| Solution clarity | 7/10 | Internal flow elegant; external is aggregation |
| Timing | 8/10 | Post-AI-spam backlash = demand for quality |
| Defensibility | 6/10 | Exam + SLA hard to copy; scraping is not |
| GTM clarity | 5/10 | Cold start needs sharpening |
| Market size | 9/10 | US job market, recurring need |

## What Investors Want to See Before Check

1. **1,000 active candidates** using the external feed (proves wedge works without recruiters)
2. **5-10 recruiters** piloting internal job posts with exam flow (proves SLA is deliverable)
3. **Weekly retention data** (candidates returning, not just signing up)

## Agentic Apply (Future Feature)

Browser automation to fill applications on behalf of users. Assessment:
- High retention potential — "set it and forget it" experience
- Risk: mass-apply undermines core quality promise
- Recommendation: gate it (candidate reviews before submit), cap at 5-10/day
- Position as convenience layer on top of curation, not the core value

## Risk Summary

Primary risk is not product — it's distribution. Two-sided marketplaces are unforgiving. Strategy: nail candidate side first via external aggregation, then bring recruiters.
