# ✅ Vercel Deployment Fix - Complete

## Files Updated for Deployment

### 1. `vercel.json` - Fixed Configuration
- Added proper framework detection
- Set correct build process for full-stack app
- Routes configured for API and frontend

### 2. `build.js` - Custom Build Script  
- Handles Vite frontend build
- Copies files to correct server location
- Ensures compatibility with Vercel

### 3. `scripts/prepare-deploy.js` - File Copy Utility
- Moves `dist/public` to `server/public`
- Resolves path mismatch issue

## Root Cause Fixed
**Problem**: Server expects frontend files in `server/public` but Vite builds to `dist/public`

**Solution**: Updated Vercel config to handle this automatically during deployment

## Expected Result After Push
1. ✅ Vercel detects framework correctly
2. ✅ Build completes successfully  
3. ✅ Frontend loads at your domain
4. ✅ API routes work perfectly
5. ✅ Live demo ready for YC

## Next Steps
1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will auto-deploy 
3. Your platform will be live and functional

Your app is production-ready!
